# dotfiles-template

This is a template for setting up a dotfiles repo for your Codespaces. First, fork this repo (or creating a new repo using this as a template, but that is less ideal) and set it up as your Codespaces dotfiles repo. Then you can place dotfiles into the `source-files` folder, and those will be merged (or created) into the corresponding files in any new Codespace's `$HOME` directory, rather than overwriting them.
