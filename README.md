# dotfiles-src

This is a template for setting up a dotfiles repo for your Codespaces. After cloning or forking this repo and setting it up as your Codespaces dotfiles repo, files that are placed in the `source-files` folder will be merged (or created) into the corresponding files in your new Codespaces' `$HOME` directory, rather than simply overwriting them.
