# dotfiles-template

This is a template for setting up a dotfiles repo for your Codespaces. After forking or copying this repo and setting it up as your Codespaces dotfiles repo, files that are placed in the `source-files` folder will be merged (or created) into the corresponding files in any new Codespace's `$HOME` directory, rather than overwriting them.
